# Array Interview Problems
- do not use Python "tricks" when answering interview problems
    * if asked to reverse string, do not use: ```my_string[::-1]```
- interview problems will seem very challenging
    * if stuck, write out what you would do manually to solve problem (brute-force)
    * highly suggested to try solving these with pen/paper or a whiteboard first
- if completely stuck on problem and tried brute forcing it
    * give it 1-2 days then try again
    * look at solution and code it out
    * wait 1-2 days and try problem again
