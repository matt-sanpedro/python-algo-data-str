# Big-O Notation

## Comparing sum1 and sum2
- as n gets large -> asympotic analysis
- sum1() is O(n) since it grows linearly with input size

## Big-O Classification
| Big-O         | Name        |
| -----------   | ----------- |
| 1             | Constant    |
| log(n)        | Logarithmic |
| n             | Linear      |
| nlog(n)       | Log Linear  |
| n^2           | Quadratic   |
| n^3           | Cubic       |
| 2^n           | Exponential |
